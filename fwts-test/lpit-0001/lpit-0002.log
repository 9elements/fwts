lpit            FAILED [MEDIUM] LPITReservedNonZero: Test 1, LPIT Native
lpit            C-state based LPI structure reserved field must be zero,
lpit            got 0xffff instead
lpit            FAILED [LOW] LPITNativeCStateLpitFlagsReserved: Test 1,
lpit            Some of the Native C-state based LPI structure flags bits
lpit            [31:2] are set, they are expected to be zero
lpit            FAILED [LOW] LPITNativeCStateLpitResidencyCounterWidth:
lpit            Test 1, Native C-state based LPI structure Residency
lpit            Structure Register Bit Width was 16 for a FFH Address
lpit            Space (e.g. a MSR), and was expecting 64.
