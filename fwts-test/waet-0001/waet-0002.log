waet            Test 1 of 1: Windows ACPI Emulated Devices Table test.
waet            WAET Table:
waet              Emulated Device Flags:    0xfffffffc
waet                Bit [0] RTC Good:       0
waet                Bit [1] PM Timer Good:  0
waet            
waet            FAILED [HIGH] WAETFlagReservedNotZero: Test 1, WAET
waet            Emulated Device Flags was 0xfffffffc and so some of
waet            reserved bits [31:2] are not zero as expected.
