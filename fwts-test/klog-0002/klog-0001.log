klog            Kernel message: [ 0.408874] CPU1: Temperature above
klog            threshold, cpu clock throttled (total events = 1)
klog            
klog            ADVICE: Test caused CPU temperature above critical
klog            threshold. The CPU has been throttled to run slower
klog            because of over-heating above the critical threshold. CPU
klog            throttling will be turned off once the CPU has cooled
klog            sufficiently. Frequent throttling may indicate poor
klog            thermal design on the machine.
