acpitables      acpitables: ACPI table settings sanity tests.
acpitables      ----------------------------------------------------------
acpitables      Test 1 of 2: Test ACPI tables.
acpitables      No FACS found, fwts has faked one instead.
acpitables      Table APIC not present to check.
acpitables      Table ECDT not present to check.
acpitables      FAILED [MEDIUM] FADTDSTNull: Test 1, FADT DSDT address is
acpitables      null.
acpitables      FAILED [MEDIUM] FADT32And64Mismatch: Test 1, FADT 32 bit
acpitables      DSDT (0x0) does not point to same physical address as 64
acpitables      bit X_DSDT (0xbf6d9b6a).
acpitables      
acpitables      ADVICE: One would expect the 32 bit DSDT and 64 bit X_DSDT
acpitables      pointers to point to the same DSDT, however they don't
acpitables      which is clearly ambiguous and wrong. The kernel works
acpitables      around this by using the 64 bit X_DSDT pointer to the
acpitables      DSDT. 
acpitables      
acpitables      FAILED [MEDIUM] FADTSMICMDZero: Test 1, FADT SMI_CMD is
acpitables      0x00, however, one or more of ACPI_ENABLE, ACPI_DISABLE,
acpitables      S4BIOS_REQ, PSTATE_CNT and CST_CNT are defined which means
acpitables      SMI_CMD should be defined otherwise SMI commands cannot be
acpitables      sent.
acpitables      
acpitables      ADVICE: The configuration seems to suggest that SMI
acpitables      command should be defined to allow the kernel to trigger
acpitables      system management interrupts via the SMD_CMD port. The
acpitables      fact that SMD_CMD is zero which is invalid means that SMIs
acpitables      are not possible through the normal ACPI mechanisms. This
acpitables      means some firmware based machine specific functions will
acpitables      not work.
acpitables      
acpitables      FAILED [MEDIUM] FADTBadPMTMRLEN: Test 1, FADT PM_TMR_LEN
acpitables      is 3, should be 4.
acpitables      
acpitables      ADVICE: FADT field PM_TMR_LEN defines the number of bytes
acpitables      decoded by PM_TMR_BLK. This fields value must be 4. If it
acpitables      is not the correct size then the kernel will not request a
acpitables      region for the pm timer block. 
acpitables      
acpitables      FAILED [MEDIUM] FADTBadGPEBLKLEN: Test 1, FADT
acpitables      GPE0_BLK_LEN is 9, should a multiple of 2.
acpitables      
acpitables      ADVICE: The FADT GPE_BLK_LEN should be a multiple of 2.
acpitables      Because it isn't, the ACPI driver will not map in the GPE0
acpitables      region. This could mean that General Purpose Events will
acpitables      not function correctly (for example lid or ac-power
acpitables      events).
acpitables      
acpitables      FAILED [MEDIUM] FADTBadGPE1BLKLEN: Test 1, FADT
acpitables      GPE1_BLK_LEN is 15, should a multiple of 2.
acpitables      
acpitables      ADVICE: The FADT GPE_BLK_LEN should be a multiple of 2.
acpitables      Because it isn't, the ACPI driver will not map in the GPE1
acpitables      region. This could mean that General Purpose Events will
acpitables      not function correctly (for example lid or ac-power
acpitables      events).
acpitables      
acpitables      FAILED [MEDIUM] FADTBadRESETREG: Test 1, FADT RESET_REG
acpitables      address space ID was 3, must be System Memory space (0),
acpitables      System I/O space (1), or PCI configuration space (2).
acpitables      
acpitables      ADVICE: If the FADT RESET_REG address space ID is not set
acpitables      correctly then ACPI writes to this register *may* nor work
acpitables      correctly, meaning a reboot via this mechanism may not
acpitables      work.
acpitables      
acpitables      Table HPET not present to check.
acpitables      Table MCFG not present to check.
acpitables      PASSED: Test 1, Table RSDT passed.
acpitables      PASSED: Test 1, Table RSDP passed.
acpitables      Table SBST not present to check.
acpitables      PASSED: Test 1, Table XSDT passed.
acpitables      
acpitables      Test 2 of 2: Test ACPI headers.
acpitables      PASSED: Test 2, Table FACP has valid signature and ID
acpitables      strings.
acpitables      PASSED: Test 2, Table RSDT has valid signature and ID
acpitables      strings.
acpitables      PASSED: Test 2, Table XSDT has valid signature and ID
acpitables      strings.
