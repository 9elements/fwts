wmi             0B3CBB35-E3C2-45ED-91C2-4C5A6D195D1C is unknown to the
wmi             kernel, a driver may need to be implemented for this GUID.
wmi             A WMI driver probably needs to be written for this WMI
wmi             event. It can checked for using:
wmi             wmi_has_guid("0B3CBB35-E3C2-45ED-91C2-4C5A6D195D1C"). One
wmi             can install a notify handler using
wmi             wmi_install_notify_handler("0B3CBB35-E3C2-45ED-91C2-4C5A6D195D1C"
wmi             , handler, NULL). http://lwn.net/Articles/391230 describes
wmi             how to write an appropriate driver.
