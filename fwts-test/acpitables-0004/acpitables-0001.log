acpitables      ADVICE: The HPET specification (http://www.intel.com
acpitables      /hardwaredesign/hpetspec_1.pdf) describes the HPET table
acpitables      in section 3.2.4 'The ACPI 2.0 HPET Description Table
acpitables      (HPET)'. The top 16 bits of the Event Timer Block ID
acpitables      specify the Vendor ID and this should not be zero. This
acpitables      won't affect the kernel behaviour, but should be fixed as
acpitables      it is an undefined ID value.
