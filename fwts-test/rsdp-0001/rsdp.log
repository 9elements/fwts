rsdp            ----------------------------------------------------------
rsdp            Test 1 of 1: RSDP Root System Description Pointer test.
rsdp            PASSED: Test 1, RSDP first checksum is correct
rsdp            PASSED: Test 1, RSDP: oem_id contains only printable
rsdp            characters.
rsdp            PASSED: Test 1, RSDP: revision is 2.
rsdp            PASSED: Test 1, RSDP: at least one of RsdtAddress or
rsdp            XsdtAddress is non-zero.
rsdp            NOTE: The RSDT and XSDT are both defined. An operating
rsdp            system supporting ACPI 1.0 should use the RSDT, otherwise
rsdp            it will use the XSDT. RSDT = 0x3674202324, XSDT =
rsdp            0x3220176896
rsdp            PASSED: Test 1, RSDP: the correct RSDT/XSDT address is
rsdp            being used.
rsdp            PASSED: Test 1, RSDP: the table is the correct length.
rsdp            PASSED: Test 1, RSDP second checksum is correct
rsdp            PASSED: Test 1, RSDP: the reserved field is zero.
