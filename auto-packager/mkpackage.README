== FWTS Uploading ==

General procedure
-----------------

Periodically we've put enough patches into fwts to deem it ready for a new upload. To do so, we
update the changelog with a summary of the changes, update the version tag, push these, then
we clone the repo, remove the .git directory and create debian source packages ready for uploading
and building in the fwts PPAs.

Here's how I went from Version V0.25.03 to V0.25.04

In the fwts git repo:

See the current version:

./update_version.sh
You need to specify the version number
The last version was V0.25.03

Use git log to see what's been added since the last tagged release, e.g.

git shortlog  V0.25.03..HEAD | sed "s/^     /  */g"

collect up one-line-summary of changes, add them to debian/changelog:

e.g.

fwts (0.25.04) quantal; urgency=low

  [Colin Ian King]
  * apci: acpitables: only check CMOS in BOOT table from firmware tables
    (LP: #1016469)
  * lib: fwts_acpi_tables: add ACPI table provenance
  * lib: fwts_acpi_tables: load tables in deterministically
  * lib: fwts_log: handle special logfile names
  * lib: log: move line counting to logging back-ends
  * lib: fwts_log: remove fwts_log_line_number(), no longer used
  * lib: fwts_framework: output all logfile names being written to
  * lib: fwts_log: add fwts_log_get_filenames()
  * lib: fwts_summary: remove references to log line number

  [Keng-Yu Lin]
  * debian: Fix up the dependency of debian packages

then:

git add debian/changelog
git commit -s -m"debian: update changelog"


Next, update the tag:

./update-version V0.25.04

git push
git push --tags

Next, create an auto-packager directory somewhere and run the mkpackage.sh script from within it. E.g

mkdir /home/cking/fwts/auto-packager
cp mkpackage.sh /home/cking/fwts/auto-packager
cd /home/cking/fwts/auto-packager
./mkpackage.sh V0.25.04

and this will clone the git repo, remove the .git directory and create packages for uploading.
For a release like Precise, it generates:

V0.25.04/precise/fwts_0.25.04
V0.25.04/oneiric/fwts_0.25.04~o*
V0.25.04/natty/fwts_0.25.04~n*
V0.25.04/lucid/fwts_0.25.04~l*

NOTE: The current release does not end with ~ suffix to the version name. This version is the
one that gets periodically uploaded to universe in the current release until we get to feature freeze.  

And dput these into the  ppa:firmware-testing-team/ppa-fwts-unstable-crack PPA

Let it shake out - build + test etc.  Get users to test against this. Onece you are OK with it,
copy the packages into ppa:firmware-testing-team/ppa-fwts-devel

Every so often during the distro release cycle copy the stable current package into universe. You can either do this on every version number bump or when you deem that a new version is really stable.

Once a package has been copied to universe, we then copy the packages from ppa:firmware-testing-team/ppa-fwts-devel to ppa:firmware-testing-team/ppa-fwts-stable.
