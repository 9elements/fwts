* lot of systems w/ atom N280 CPU have a BIOS that doesn't report all possible CPU speeds (bug 422858). Is that something the fw kit can detect?

Hotkey testing:
- Get the OEM name from dmidecode such as Dell, Lenovo, Acer...
- Get the keymap from /lib/udev/keymaps/ according to the OEM name
- Ask user to press hotkey
- Capture the scancode and compare to the default one in OEM keymap
- If it is the same function, it passes. Otherwise, it fails
- If it fails, normally BIOS generates wrong scancode. We need BIOS to fix that.
